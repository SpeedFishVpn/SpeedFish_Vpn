        "title": "About the 0.19 version update",
        "content": "    After considering it for a long time, it was decided to remove the daily limit traffic. The previous consideration was to create a relatively good network environment. Removing the traffic restriction may cause the server to be overloaded and shut down in the future. However, not deleting the traffic restriction violated the original intention of the software. I originally built a few VPNs because of the need of the work. Later, I found that the traffic was often excessive, so I decided to share it with you. This will have today's speedfish.\n    Since its release, it is already the 19th version. From the pure sharing before, to the contact with googleplay mall, there is a strong competition, I want to fight for the first, I want to make my own software, I want to add more software. More servers, I want to give you a better experience. However, contrary to expectations, the road to sharing is far away and difficult. 0.1.9 will be the last update of this UI, the next month to see the effect, if it can be maintained, I will continue to stick to it. If it can't be maintained, I will delete some servers, leave a server for the friends I need, and increase the traffic limit.\n    Finally, thank you for your support！\n"

So the UI is messy.)! I found problems with two servers yesterday! Temporary changes, now joined the global, as well as local proxy options, to facilitate the acceleration of some domestic browsing (received a few emails said to open the country before the slow!)!\n    I received a few warm messages today! Really a little touched! Finally, thank you for your support! I wish you all a happy New Year!"
